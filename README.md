# sails-auth

### Sails-Auth ready for Sails.js v1.0

*This repo is forked from langateam/sails-auth*

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/)-based User Authentication system for Sails.js applications.

## 1. Install
```sh
$ npm install sails-auth-new --save
```
This will install `sails-auth` as a Sails Hook. The Hook uses
[marlinspike](https://github.com/tjwebb/marlinspike) to inject the relevant
Controllers, Policies, etc into your Sails application.

## 2. Configure

#### `config/custom.js`

By default, the `local` and `basic` strategies are enabled. See
[config/custom.js](https://github.com/dominicrico/sails-auth/blob/master/config/custom.js)
for examples of how to add and configure additional authentication strategies.

Also set the bcrypt config for salt rounds here and the appUrl.

```js
  appUrl: 'localhost:1337', //for development
  bcrypt: {
    /**
     * Specifiy number of salt rounds to perform on password. Values >10 are
     * slow.
     */
    rounds: 8
  },
  passport: {
    /**
     * Strategies go here
     */
  }
```

## 3. Authenticate!

Create users as you normally would (`POST` to `/user`). Authenticate using the endpoint of the provider you've chosen.

#### Local
Authenticate with the local strategy via a `POST` to `/auth/local` with params
`identifier` (email) and `password`). This will also create a session. See [passport.local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) for more.

#### HTTP Basic and Digest
See [passport.http](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http).

#### Additional Passport Strategies
- [passport.google](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth)
- [passport.twitter](http://passportjs.org/guide/twitter/)
- [passport.github](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github)
- [passport.facebook](http://passportjs.org/guide/facebook/)
- et al

#### `/user/me`
Returns `User` for this authenticated session.

## Permissions
